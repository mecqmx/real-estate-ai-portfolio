## Portfolio Documentation Checklist (Prioritized)

**I. Essential Documentation (Complete ASAP)**

*   [ ] **README.md (Project Root):**
    *   [ ] Project Title
    *   [ ] Brief Description of your portfolio and its purpose
    *   [ ] Live Demo Link (if deployed)
    *   [ ] Technologies Used (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, etc.)
    *   [ ] Setup Instructions (how to run the project locally)
    *   [ ] Key Features
    *   [ ] Project Structure (brief overview of important directories)
    *   [ ] License Information (e.g., MIT License)
    *   [ ] Contact Information (your email or portfolio link)
*   [ ] **Authentication Flow Diagram (docs/authentication-flow.mmd):**
    *   [ ] Ensure the diagram is up-to-date and accurately reflects the authentication process.
    *   [ ] Add a brief explanation of the diagram in the `README.md` or a separate documentation file.
*   [ ] **Environment Variables:**
    *   [ ] Document all required environment variables in the `README.md` or a separate `.env.example` file (without revealing sensitive values).  Explain the purpose of each variable.

**II. Important Documentation (Complete Soon)**

*   [ ] **Component Documentation:**
    *   [ ] For complex or reusable components, add comments or separate documentation files explaining their purpose, props, and usage.  Use JSDoc syntax for comments.
*   [ ] **API Route Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Document your Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/auth/signin`). Explain the purpose of each route, the expected request body, and the response format.
*   [ ] **Code Comments:**
    *   [ ] Add clear and concise comments to your code, especially in complex or critical sections.  Focus on explaining *why* the code is doing something, not just *what* it's doing.

**III. Nice-to-Have Documentation (Complete Later)**

*   [ ] **Testing Documentation:**
    *   [ ] If you have unit tests or integration tests, document how to run them and what they cover.
*   [ ] **Deployment Documentation:**
    *   [ ] Explain how you deployed your portfolio (e.g., Vercel, Netlify).
*   [ ] **Contribution Guidelines:**
    *   [ ] If you plan to make your portfolio open source, add contribution guidelines.
*   [ ] **Storybook Integration:**
    *   [ ] If you use Storybook for component development, document how to use it.
